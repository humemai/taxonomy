# Wikidata

This repository contains Python scripts designed to process and analyze the raw Wikidata
dump files. It enables the extraction of key information, such as entity labels,
relationships, and property usage statistics. There are five scripts, and they can all
be run in parallel. As of 05-Jan-2025, there are 113,472,282 entities and 12,327
properties in wikidata the database.

## Storage Requirements

Working with Wikidata requires significant storage space. Ensure you have sufficient
capacity before proceeding.

### Downloading the Latest Dump File

Wikidata provides entity dumps in various formats. The recommended file for this process
is `latest-all.json.gz`.

1. **Install aria2 for faster downloads**:

   ```sh
   pip install aria2
   ```

2. **Download the file**:

   ```sh
   aria2c --max-connection-per-server=16 https://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/entities/latest-all.json.gz
   ```

   As of 05-Jan-2025, the file size for `latest-all.json.gz` is approximately `142 GB`.

## Understanding Wikidata Entities

### What Does a Wikidata Entity Look Like?

A typical Wikidata entity is structured as a JSON object. It includes various attributes
like `id`, `type`, `labels`, `descriptions`, `aliases`, and `claims`. Below is an
example of a Wikidata entity:

Example Entity (`Q42` - Douglas Adams)

```json
{
  "id": "Q42",
  "type": "item",
  "labels": {
    "en": {
      "language": "en",
      "value": "Douglas Adams"
    }
  },
  "descriptions": {
    "en": {
      "language": "en",
      "value": "English author and humorist"
    }
  },
  "aliases": {
    "en": [
      {
        "language": "en",
        "value": "Douglas Noel Adams"
      }
    ]
  },
  "claims": {
    "P31": [
      {
        "mainsnak": {
          "snaktype": "value",
          "property": "P31",
          "datavalue": {
            "value": {
              "entity-type": "item",
              "numeric-id": 5,
              "id": "Q5"
            },
            "type": "wikibase-entityid"
          },
          "datatype": "wikibase-item"
        },
        "type": "statement",
        "id": "Q42$F8F97AE9-C88E-41FA-B527-F34A49EB2E59",
        "rank": "normal"
      }
    ]
  },
  "modified": "2024-12-03T18:56:58Z"
}
```

## Get all the properties as json: [`run_properties.py`](run_properties.py)

Simply run:

```bash
python run_properties.py
```

This will run the SPARQL query to fetch properties from the Wikidata website, retrieve
their aliases and descriptions, and save the results to a file called `properties.json`.

`properties.json` will look like:

```json
{
  "P6": {
  "label": "head of government",
  "aliases": ["leader", "chief of state"],
  "description": "The principal leader of a government, particularly a nation."
},
...
}
```

Each entry in the JSON file contains the following fields:

- `property_id`: The unique identifier for the property (e.g., `P6`).
- `label`: The name or label of the property (e.g., "head of government").
- `aliases`: A list of alternative labels for the property (e.g., ["leader", "chief of
  state"]).
- `description`: A description of the property (e.g., "The principal leader of a
  government, particularly a nation.").

**On my machine, this took about 1 hour and 11 minutes.**

## Get subclass_of (P279) triples: [`run_p279.py`](run_p279.py)

To extract `subclass_of` (`P279`) relationships from the Wikidata dump, you can use the
provided Python script `run_p279.py`. This script processes the raw JSON dump, extracts
`P279` claims, and saves them in a TSV format for easier downstream analysis.

### Steps to Extract `P279` Triples

1. **Run the `run_p279.py` script**: Use the following command to extract `P279`
   triples:

   ```bash
   python run_p279.py \
   --dump_file latest-all.json.gz \
   --p279_dir P279 \
   --num_entities_per_batch 50000 \
   --dummy
   ```

   - `--dump_file`: Path to the Wikidata JSON dump (`latest-all.json.gz`).
   - `--p279_dir`: Directory where the `P279` triples will be stored (default: `P279`).
   - `--num_entities_per_batch`: Number of entities to process per batch (default:
     50,000).
   - `--dummy`: Optional flag to process only the first batch for testing purposes.

2. **Output Structure**: The script will save `P279` triples in a tab-separated file
   (`.tsv`) with the following format:

   ```tsv
   entity_id\tproperty_id\tvalue_id
   ...
   ```

   Each file will contain a batch of triples, named as `batch_0.tsv`, `batch_1.tsv`,
   etc., in the specified output directory.

3. **Check Logs**: A log file, `run_p279.log`, will be created in the parent directory
   of `--p279_dir`. It includes information about the processing time, total entities
   processed, and any errors encountered during JSON decoding.

4. **Sample Output**: Suppose you extract `P279` triples from the provided example
   entity (`Q42` - Douglas Adams). The result in the output file would look like this:

   ```tsv
   entity_id\tproperty_id\tvalue_id
   Q42\tP279\tQ5
   Q123\tP279\tQ456
   ...
   ```

### Tips for Efficient Processing

- **Batch Size**: Adjust the `--num_entities_per_batch` parameter based on your systemâ€™s
  memory and processing capabilities. Larger batches reduce file overhead but require
  more memory.
- **Dummy Mode**: Use `--dummy` mode to test the script with minimal processing.
- **Parallel Downloads**: For faster download of the dump file, use a tool like `aria2`
  as mentioned earlier.

Once the script has finished running, you will have all `P279` triples extracted and
saved in an easy-to-process format, ready for further analysis or integration into other
systems.

**On my machine, this took about 13 hours and 56 minutes.**

## Get instance_of (P31) triples: [`run_p31.py`](run_p31.py)

To extract `instance_of` (`P31`) relationships from the Wikidata dump, use the
`run_p31.py` script:

### Steps to Extract `P31` Triples

1. Run the script: `python run_p31.py --dump_file latest-all.json.gz --p31_dir P31
--num_entities_per_batch 50000`

   - `--dump_file`: Path to the Wikidata JSON dump (`latest-all.json.gz`).
   - `--p31_dir`: Directory to store `P31` triples (default: `P31`).
   - `--num_entities_per_batch`: Number of entities per batch (default: 50,000).
   - `--dummy`: Optional flag to process only the first batch.

2. Output Structure: The script saves triples in `.tsv` files under `--p31_dir`:

   ```tsv
   entity_id\tproperty_id\tvalue_id
   Q42\tP31\tQ5
   ...
   ```

3. Logs: A log file `run_p31.log` is created with details like processing time and
   errors.

4. Note that this can run in parallel with `run_p279.py`. Do so to save time.

**On my machine, this took about 15 hours and 58 minutes.**

## Extract English Descriptions from Wikidata [`extract_en_descriptions.py`](extract_en_descriptions.py)

This script parses a compressed Wikidata JSON dump (e.g., latest-all.json.gz) and
extracts the English descriptions of entities. It processes entities in batches,
temporarily storing each batch as a TSV file. After aggregating all batches into a
single JSON file, the temporary TSV directory is deleted.

### Usage

```bash
python extract_en_descriptions.py \
 --dump_file latest-all.json.gz \
 --desc_dir Desc \
 --num_entities_per_batch 50000 \
 [--dummy]
```

- **--dump_file** (str, default: `latest-all.json.gz`)  
  Path to the compressed Wikidata JSON dump.

- **--desc_dir** (str, default: `Desc`)  
  Directory where the TSV batch files are temporarily stored during processing.

- **--num_entities_per_batch** (int, default: 50000)  
  Number of entities to process per batch before writing results to a TSV file.

- **--dummy** (flag)  
  If set, only one batch of entities is processed. Useful for quick testing.

### Output

- **Final JSON File:**  
  A file named en_description.json containing all extracted (entity_id, description)
  pairs.

- **Log File:**  
  A log file named run*`en_desc.log` is generated in the \_parent directory* of
  --desc_dir. This log includes:

  - Total processing time
  - Total entities processed
  - Number of JSON decoding errors
  - Path to the (now-deleted) TSV output directory

- **Temporary TSV Files:**  
  During processing, TSV files (e.g., `batch_0.tsv`, `batch_1.tsv`, etc.) are created in
  the directory specified by --desc_dir. **After aggregation, the entire --desc_dir
  directory is deleted**, leaving only `en_description.json` and the log file.

### Example

```bash
python extract_en_descriptions.py \
 --dump_file latest-all.json.gz \
 --desc_dir Desc \
 --num_entities_per_batch 50000
```

After the script completes:

- The final JSON file `en_description.json` will contain all the extracted (entity_id,
  description) pairs.
- The log file `run_en_desc.log` (located in the parent folder of Desc) will detail the
  extraction process.
- The temporary TSV files in the Desc directory will have been removed.

## Get English labels: [`run_entityid2label.py`](run_entityid2label.py)

The `run_entityid2label.py` script extracts `entity ID` to `English labels` mappings
from the Wikidata JSON dump and saves them as a JSON file.

### Steps to Extract English Labels

1. Run the script:

```bash
 python run_entityid2label.py \
 --dump_file latest-all.json.gz \
 --output_file entityid2label.json \
 --dummy
```

- `--dump_file`: Path to the Wikidata JSON dump (`latest-all.json.gz`).
- `--output_file`: Path to save the `entityid2label.json` file (default:
  `entityid2label.json`).
- `--dummy`: Optional flag to process only the first 10,000 entities for testing.

2. Output Structure: The extracted labels are saved as a JSON file
   (`entityid2label.json`) with the following format:

   ```json
   { "Q42": "Douglas Adams", "Q123": "September", ... }
   ```

3. Logs: A log file `run_entityid2label.log` is generated, containing:
   - Total processing time (in days, hours, minutes, and seconds).
   - Total entities processed.
   - Total entities with English labels.
   - Decoding errors.
   - Path to the output file.

This script is ideal for extracting and saving mappings of entity IDs to their English
labels in a simple, usable format.

**On my machine, this took about 2 hours and 38 minutes.**

## Get the stats of the properties used: [`run_property_stats.py`](run_property_stats.py)

The `run_property_stats.py` script calculates the usage statistics of properties in the
Wikidata JSON dump and saves the results as a JSON file.

### Steps to Get Property Stats

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python run_property_stats.py \
   --dump_file latest-all.json.gz \
   --output_file property_stats.json \
   --dummy
   ```

   - `--dump_file`: Path to the Wikidata JSON dump (`latest-all.json.gz`).
   - `--output_file`: Path to save the `property_stats.json` file (default:
     `property_stats.json`).
   - `--dummy`: Optional flag to process only the first 10,000 entities for testing.

2. Output Structure: The property statistics are saved as a JSON file
   (`property_stats.json`) with the following format:

   ```json
   { "P31": 25000, "P279": 18000, ... }
   ```

   Each property ID (e.g., `P31`) is a key, and its value is the number of times the
   property appears in the dump.

3. Logs: A log file `run_property_stats.log` is generated, containing:
   - Total processing time (in days, hours, minutes, and seconds).
   - Total entities processed.
   - Decoding errors.
   - Path to the output file.
   - Top 5 most frequently used properties.

**On my machine, this took about 2 hours and 40 minutes.**

## Building a hierarchy using the P31 and P279 triples

This section requires that you ran all the 6 scripts above, which can run in parallel.

### [`process_p31_p279.py`](./process_p31_p279.py) Script Overview

The [`process_p31_p279.py`](./process_p31_p279.py) script is designed to process

**On my machine, this took about 6 minutes.**

### [`get_paths.py`](./get_paths.py) Script Overview

[`get_paths.py`](./get_paths.py) is a Python script designed to generate and export
unique hierarchical paths for the top N classes from a dataset. It processes
relationships between entities, extracts meaningful paths based on specified directions,
and logs essential statistics for each class. The output consists of separate TSV
(Tab-Separated Values) files for each class along with corresponding log files.

#### Key Features

- **Path Generation:** Constructs unique upward and/or downward paths using Depth-First
  Search (DFS) based on user-specified directions.
- **Trie Data Structure:** Utilizes a Trie to efficiently store and retrieve unique
  paths, eliminating duplicates.
- **Configurable Parameters:** Users can specify the number of top classes (`N`),
  maximum path depth (`max_depth`), maximum paths per class (`max_paths_per_class`), and
  the direction of path generation (`upward`, `downward`, or `both`).
- **Progress Monitoring:** Integrates `tqdm` for real-time progress tracking.
- **Logging:** Records statistics such as the number of paths generated, unique paths
  extracted, time taken, and memory usage for each class.
- **Error Handling:** Manages file I/O errors and detects cycles during path generation
  to prevent infinite loops.

#### Usage

Run the script via the command line with required and optional arguments:

```bash
python get_paths.py \
--num_classes 20 \
--max_depth 5 \
--max_paths_per_class 1000 \
--allowed_threshold 0.3 \
--batch_size 50000 \
--direction both \
--output_dir ./extracted_paths
```

- `--num_classes`: Number of top classes to process (default: 10)
- `--max-depth`: Maximum depth for path generation (default: None)
- `--max_paths_per_class`: Maximum number of paths per class for each direction
  (default: None)
- `--batch-size`: Number of combined paths per batch TSV file (default: 50000)
- `--direction`: Direction of paths to include (`upward`, `downward`, or `both`)
- `--allowed_threshold`: Minimum fraction of allowed nodes (popular nodes) in a path.
  Higher this number is, the lower number of paths will be generated (default: 0.3)
- `--output_dir`: Directory to save output files **(required)**

#### Core Components

- **TrieNode & PathTrie Classes:** Implement a Trie for storing unique paths. `TrieNode`
  represents each node, while `PathTrie` handles insertion and traversal of paths.
- **Functions:**
  - `get_memory_usage()`: Returns current memory usage in MB.
  - `generate_paths_dfs()`: Generates all complete paths from a node using DFS.
  - `sample_and_combine_paths()`: Processes top `num_classes` classes, generates paths,
    ensures uniqueness, and exports them based on the specified direction.
  - `invert_mapping()`: Converts child-to-parent mappings to parent-to-child mappings.
  - `format_time()`: Formats elapsed time into a readable string.

#### Execution Flow

1. **Argument Parsing:** Handles user-specified parameters, including the required
   `--direction`.
2. **Setup:**
   - Creates the output directory (`extracted_paths` by default).
   - Loads `class_counts.json` and `child_to_parents.json` from the
     `./process_p31_p279/` directory.
   - Inverts the child-to-parent mapping to parent-to-children.
3. **Path Processing:**
   - For each of the top `num_classes` classes:
     - Generates upward and/or downward paths based on the `--direction` argument with
       optional depth and path limits.
     - Samples paths if `max_paths_per_class` is specified.
     - Inserts paths into a Trie to ensure uniqueness.
     - Depending on the direction:
       - **Both Directions (`both`)**: Combines unique upward and downward paths and
         exports them in batched TSV files.
       - **Only Upward (`upward`)**: Exports unique upward paths in batched TSV files.
       - **Only Downward (`downward`)**: Exports unique downward paths in batched TSV
         files.
     - Logs statistics to `{class}.log` including path counts, time taken, and memory
       usage.
4. **Completion:** Reports total execution time and confirms successful completion.

#### Dependencies

- **Standard Libraries:** `os`, `json`, `random`, `time`, `argparse`, `itertools`,
  `collections`, `typing`, `sys`.
- **Third-Party Libraries:** `tqdm` (progress bars), `psutil` (memory monitoring).

Ensure all dependencies are installed, for example:

```bash
pip install tqdm psutil
```

#### Performance Considerations

- **Memory Efficiency:** Uses Tries to minimize memory usage by avoiding duplicate path
  storage.
- **Sampling & Depth Limitation:** Controls resource usage by limiting the number of
  paths and their depth.
- **Progress Tracking:** Provides real-time feedback to monitor processing status.

#### Output

- **TSV Files:** For each processed class, one or more TSV files are created:
  - `batch_1.tsv`, `batch_2.tsv`, etc.: Each file contains a batch of unique paths based
    on the specified direction.
- **Log Files:** For each processed class, a log file `{class}.log` is created
  containing:
  - Initial number of upward and/or downward paths.
  - Number of unique upward and/or downward paths after Trie insertion.
  - Time taken for processing the class.
  - Memory usage during processing.
  - Direction of paths included.

#### Error Handling

- **File I/O Errors:** The script handles errors related to reading input files and
  writing output files, logging appropriate error messages without terminating the
  entire process.
- **Cycle Detection:** During path generation, the script detects and skips paths that
  would introduce cycles, preventing infinite loops.

#### Example

What I used was

```bash
python get_paths.py \
--num_classes 10000 \
--allowed_threshold 0.3 \
--direction both \
--output_dir
```

#### Notes

- Ensure that the input JSON files (`class_counts.json` and `child_to_parents.json`) are
  correctly formatted and located in the `./process_p31_p279/` directory.
- The script is optimized for large datasets, but resource usage can still be
  significant depending on the size and complexity of the input data. Adjust `max_depth`
  and `max_paths_per_class` as needed to balance performance and comprehensiveness.

This script is ideal for analyzing hierarchical data structures, such as taxonomies or
ontologies, by extracting and managing unique paths efficiently.

### [`process_paths.py`](./process_paths.py) Script Overview

This script processes the hierarchical paths that were generated and saved by
`get_paths.py`. It combines the extracted paths for some subset of classes (e.g., the
top-K classes by instance count) into a single aggregated dataset, computes summary
statistics about path lengths, and saves them for downstream analysis. Key steps
include:

- **Load `entityid2label`**: A JSON file mapping entity IDs to human-readable labels,
  used to generate a vocabulary file where each entityâ€™s ID is mapped to its label.
- **Load `class_counts.json`**: A JSON file mapping class IDs to the number of instances
  of each class, sorted in descending order of frequency.
- **Select Classes**: The script can process the top K classes from `class_counts.json`
  (e.g., 100, 1,000, 10,000). For each K in a user-specified list:
  1. Identify the subdirectory in `extracted_paths` for each class among the top K.
  2. Aggregate all `.tsv` files under those subdirectories into one big list of paths.
  3. Compute path-length statistics (e.g., minimum, maximum, average, median, mode).
  4. Produce a single histogram of all path lengths for these classes.
  5. Count how many times each entity appears in the aggregated paths, then sort by
     frequency.
  6. Save four JSON files:
     - `counts_top_{K}.json`: A dictionary of entity IDs to their frequencies in all
       paths for these K classes (sorted by descending frequency).
     - `vocab_top_{K}.json`: The same entities in the same order, with entity IDs mapped
       to their labels.
     - `en_description_top_{K}.json`: A dictionary of entity IDs to their English
       descriptions.
     - `stats_top_{K}.json` containing the overall path-length statistics across the
       aggregated paths of the top K classes.

**Core Features**:

- Single histogram per top-K selection (no per-class histograms).
- Single set of aggregated path-length statistics per top-K selection.
- Generation of entity frequency counts and vocabulary mappings for these aggregated
  paths.

**Sample Usage**:

```bash
python process_paths.py \
--num_classes 10 100 1000 10000 \
--entityid2label_json ./entityid2label.json \
--class_counts_json ./process_p31_p279/class_counts.json \
--extracted_paths_dir ./extracted_paths/allowed_threshold_0.3/ \
--output_dir ./process_paths/allowed_threshold_0.3/
```

This will:

- Create (if needed) a folder named `process_paths`.
- For each of the top-K lists (10, 100, 1000, 10000):
  - Read all paths from the corresponding classesâ€™ folders under `./extracted_paths`.
  - Build a single histogram of path lengths and save it as
    `hist_path_lengths_top_{K}.png`.
  - Compute stats (min, max, average, median, mode) for path lengths across all these
    paths and save them in `stats_{K}.json`.
  - Store entity frequencies in `counts_{K}.json` and their labels in `vocab_{K}.json`.

### [`train.py`](./train.py) Script Overview

`train.py` is a comprehensive training script designed to fine-tune a GPT-2 language
model using a custom dataset derived from Wikidata. It incorporates efficient data
loading techniques, a custom tokenizer with additional special tokens, and a unique
class-aware sampling mechanism to ensure balanced training across classes.

#### Key Components

- **Command Line Argument Parsing**  
  The script begins by parsing various command line arguments to configure the training
  process. Options include:

  - Maximum sequence length (`--max_length`)
  - Batch size per device (`--per_device_train_batch_size`)
  - Flags for FP16 training (`--fp16`), CUDA usage (`--no_cuda`), and more.
  - Sampling mode selection (e.g., `class_aware` vs. `iid`)
  - loss_threshold (`--loss_threshold` so that it stops training when the loss is less
    than this threshold)
  - Options to load from a checkpoint or start training from scratch

- **Custom Tokenizer Creation**  
  The script checks for an existing custom tokenizer directory. If not found, it creates
  a new tokenizer based on the GPT-2 model by adding special tokens such as `<BOS>`,
  `<EOS>`, `<PAD>`, and `<DOWNWARD>`. This tokenizer is then saved for future runs.

- **Efficient Data Loading with Lazy Dataset**  
  To handle large datasets efficiently, the script constructs an
  **EfficientLazyDataset** that:

  - Builds an index of (file index, byte offset) pairs for each non-empty line in TSV
    files.
  - Lazily loads and tokenizes each line during training, reducing memory usage.
  - Supports a `sample_first_batch` option to limit the dataset to the first batch per
    class.

- **Custom Class-Aware Sampling**  
  A custom trainer class (`MyTrainer`) extends Hugging Faceâ€™s `Trainer` to include
  class-aware sampling:

  - Computes sample weights based on the frequency of class labels derived from TSV file
    paths.
  - Uses a weighted random sampler (or a numpy-based sampler for very large datasets) to
    ensure balanced representation of classes during training.

- **Model Architecture and Checkpointing**  
  Depending on the selected model size (`tiny`, `small`, `medium`, or `large`), the
  script:

  - Configures the model architecture with appropriate embedding dimensions, number of
    layers, heads, etc.
  - Either loads a pre-trained model from a checkpoint or initializes a new GPT-2 model
    from scratch.
  - Resizes token embeddings to match the vocabulary size of the custom tokenizer and
    sets special token IDs.

- **Training Setup and Execution**  
  The training parameters are configured using Hugging Faceâ€™s `TrainingArguments`,
  including:

  - Output directory setup with options for logging and checkpoint saving frequency.
  - Device configuration (CUDA or CPU based on availability and user preference).
  - Optional timing of data loading to monitor performance.

  Finally, the training process is initiated via the `trainer.train()` call, with
  support for resuming from checkpoints if necessary.

### [`build_taxonomy.py`](./build_taxonomy.py) Script Overview

The `build_taxonomy.py` script is designed to generate a hierarchical taxonomy tree
using a GPT-2 language model. It leverages a custom-trained model and tokenizer along
with a curated set of phrases to recursively construct a tree where each node represents
a meaningful phrase or class. This script is especially useful for taxonomy generation
and knowledge graph analysis.

#### Key Features

- **Custom Model and Tokenizer Loading:**  
  Loads a GPT-2 model and its corresponding tokenizer from specified checkpoint
  directories. This allows for a tailored language model that is fine-tuned for the task
  of taxonomy generation.

- **Phrase Vocabulary and Trie Construction:**  
  Reads a set of valid phrases from JSON files and builds a trie data structure to
  efficiently validate and manage token sequences. This ensures that only acceptable
  phrases are included during the tree expansion process.

- **Hierarchical Tree Construction:**  
  Begins with a root node (`<BOS>`) and recursively expands the tree by generating
  candidate child phrases. Each new phrase is validated against the pre-loaded
  vocabulary and trie, ensuring a structured and non-redundant hierarchy.

- **Parallel Batch Generation and Expansion:**  
  Implements parallel batch generation of candidate phrases using nucleus (top-p)
  sampling with temperature control. The recursive tree expansion is parallelized via
  threading, significantly speeding up the generation process.

- **Stochastic Generation:**  
  The taxonomy generation process is inherently stochastic, meaning that the output can
  vary with each run. You can adjust the level of randomness by modifying
  hyperparameters such as the sampling temperature and top-p threshold. Lower
  temperature values and stricter top-p filtering make the generation more
  deterministic, while higher values yield more diverse and creative outputs.

- **Visualization and Export:**  
  Provides utilities to convert the hierarchical tree into a NetworkX directed graph.
  The taxonomy can be visualized interactively using PyVis or Dash Cytoscape and is also
  saved as a JSON file for further analysis.

- **Configurable Parameters:**  
  Offers extensive command-line options to control various aspects of the generation
  process such as:
  - Number of classes to load
  - Maximum tree depth and width (number of children per node)
  - Number of generation attempts per node
  - Top-p sampling threshold and temperature for text generation

#### Example Usage

To run the script with specific parameters, use the following command:

```bash
python build_taxonomy.py \
--tokenizer_path "./custom_tokenizer" \
--num_classes 10 \
--force_device cuda \
--top_p 0.9 \
--max_depth 4 \
--max_width 16 \
--max_tokens_per_phrase 20 \
--temperature 0.5 \
--allowed_threshold 0.7 \
--loss_threshold 0.1 \
--model_size tiny \
--width_decay_factor 0.8
```

This command will:

- Load a custom tokenizer and GPT-2 model.
- Build a phrase trie from the top 10 classes.
- Initiate the tree expansion from the `<BOS>` token.
- Generate candidate phrases using top-p sampling and temperature-controlled randomness.
- Expand the tree up to a maximum depth of 32, with each node having at most 4 child
  nodes.
- Save the resulting taxonomy as a JSON file and display the hierarchical structure in
  the console.

#### Under the Hood

The script is organized into several logical sections:

- **Utility Functions:** For loading models, tokenizers, and phrase data.
- **Trie Construction:** Implements a trie data structure to store and validate
  tokenized phrases.
- **Tree Node Management:** Uses a `TreeNode` class to represent each node in the
  taxonomy, managing parent-child relationships and branch retrieval.
- **Batch Generation:** Generates candidate phrases in batches, applying nucleus
  filtering and temperature adjustments to control randomness.
- **Parallel Tree Expansion:** Expands nodes recursively and concurrently using a thread
  pool, enabling efficient exploration of possible taxonomy branches.
- **Visualization:** Converts the taxonomy tree into a NetworkX graph, and provides
  options for visualizing the graph interactively using PyVis or Dash Cytoscape.

Overall, `build_taxonomy.py` provides a robust framework for generating and visualizing
hierarchical taxonomies. Its stochastic nature allows for diverse outputs, and by
fine-tuning the hyperparameters, you can control how deterministic or creative the
resulting taxonomy will be.

### [`run_visualization_server.py`](./run_visualization_server.py) Script Overview

**Overview:**

- The script loads a taxonomy graph from a JSON file (constructed based on the specified
  configuration parameters) and converts it into a NetworkX directed graph.
- It visualizes the graph using Dash Cytoscape with the dagre layout, arranging the
  nodes in a balanced, left-to-right hierarchical structure.
- Nodes are rendered with clear labels and styling (e.g., light sky blue background,
  black text), while edges are styled in a light gray color.
- Upon launching, the script starts a Dash server bound to the specified host and port
  and automatically opens the graph in a web browser.
- This interactive visualization allows users to explore the taxonomy graph, making it a
  useful tool for analyzing hierarchical structures.
